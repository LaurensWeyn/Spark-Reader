Its shape will rarely be quite the same as that of the kanji. When it appears at the bottom of another primitive, it is straightened out, almost as if the weight of the upper element had bent it out of shape. And when it appears to the right of another element, the short horizontal line that gets the shape started is omitted and it is stretched out and narrowed, all for reasons of space and aesthetics.

Here we have the <i>morning</i>-<b>tide</b>, its complement. By the way, if you missed the question about the number of primitives, it is probably because you forgot what we said earlier about kanji becoming primitives, independently of the pieces that make them up.

By the way, this is not the first time, nor will it be the last, that we learn a kanji whose key word is the same, or almost the same, as a primitive element based on it, but whose shape differs somewhat. There is no cause to worry. By using the primitive in a variety of other characters, as we have done here, the confusion will be averted as a matter of course. In most cases, as here, the primitive element is taken from a part of the fuller kanji."		The soil under a graveyard is full of graves.

To associate the <b>peach tree</b> with the primitive for a <i>portent</i>, recall the famous Japanese legend of Momotarō, the <b>Peach</b> Boy. It begins once upon a time with a fisherman and his wife who wanted badly to have a child, but none was born to them. Then one day the old man caught a giant <b>peach</b>, out of which jumped a healthy young lad whom they named <b>Peach</b> Boy. Though the boy was destined to perform heroic deeds, his birth also <i>portended</i> great misfortune (how else could he become a hero?).

Sauron´s One fiery eye stare at Frodo and it is a sign of portent. Evil will become whomever the eye is staring upon.	You lost a staring contest with a turtle because you blinked your eye before he did. (The contest wasn´t fair, because turtles have nictitating membranes, and don´t need to blink so often.)

In this frame we finally see why. The <i>drop</i> added as a fourth and final stroke means that we have to do with a normal-sized <b>dog</b>, which compared to the <i>St. Bernard</i> is no more than a <i>drop</i> in the kennel.	* As a primitive this character can take two meanings. In the form given here it will mean a very small dog (which we shall refer to as a <i>chihuahua</i> for convenience sake).

Despite the strong phonetic similarity, there will be no problem keeping the key word <b>special</b> distinct from the character we met earlier for <i>specialty</i> (Frame 47), since the latter has immediate connotations lacking in this kanji.

Even though the practice is originally a Hindu one, and in any case no longer followed among the majority of Japanese Buddhist monks, the Buddha's refusal to take the life of any sentient being makes it only fitting that the <i>cows</i> should be placed on the sacred grounds of a <i>Buddhist temple</i> in this kanji.

In general, the second stroke does not cut through the first - or if it does in some fonts, only slightly.	To remember the primitive meaning, picture someone sitting on the ground performing Seppuku...with a spoon. http://tinyurl.com/co48k.	Not only is stroke order important, but also be sure to note the direction of a stroke.

The abstract notion of <i>person</i> so often has a relation to the meaning of the kanji that confusion readily sets in. So many of the previous stories have included people in them that simply to use <i>person</i> for a primitive meaning would be risky. We need to be more specific, to focus on one particular <i>person</i>. Try to choose someone who has not figured in the stories so far, perhaps a colorful member of the family or a friend whom you have known for a long time. That individual will appear again and again, so be sure to choose someone who excites your imagination.</div>	"Behold Mister T (of ""A-Team"" fame)! I chose Mr.T because he´s sure to make amusing stories. He is a very versatile character since he´s both the big, tough guy and the “moralistic” person, telling kids not “to do drugs or alcohol”. He is easy to imagine, the heavy gold chains are probably the most prominent feature of the character. And last but not least you can always pepper your story with the famous line “I pity da foo!” * Fittingly, on the left side of the kanji, it looks like a “T”."
